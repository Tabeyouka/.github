# Fukuoka Restaurant Crawler and UI
> This is a web service that crawls restaurant information from Tabelog and provides a better user interface for users to browse restaurants in Fukuoka, Japan. The service is built using React for the frontend and Laravel for the backend.

## How it works
The service crawls Tabelog, a popular Japanese restaurant review website, using web scraping techniques to extract relevant information such as restaurant name, cuisine type, rating, location, and reviews. The data is then stored in a database and displayed on a user-friendly web interface built with React.

The backend is built with Laravel, a PHP web framework, and provides RESTful APIs for the front-end to interact with the database. Users can search for restaurants by name, cuisine type, location, or rating. They can also filter restaurants by various criteria, such as address, phone number.

## Technology stack
The service is built using the following technologies:

- React for building the frontend UI
- Laravel for building the backend APIs
- MySQL for managing the database
- Tailwind CSS for frontend design
<!-- - Docker for containerization and deployment -->

## Installation
<!--
To run the service locally, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/fukuoka-restaurant-crawler.git
Install the dependencies for the back-end: cd backend && composer install
Set up the database: php artisan migrate
Start the back-end server: php artisan serve
Install the dependencies for the front-end: cd frontend && npm install
Start the front-end server: npm start
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000
Deployment
To deploy the service, you can use Docker:

Build the Docker image: docker build -t fukuoka-restaurant-crawler .
Run the Docker container: docker run -p 80:80 fukuoka-restaurant-crawler
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost
You can also deploy the service to a cloud platform such as AWS or Heroku.
