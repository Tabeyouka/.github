# Fukuoka Restaurant Crawler and UI
> This project is a Japanese restaurant review service implemented using React, TypeScript, Laravel 10, and PHP. The service provides a platform for users to search for Japanese restaurants and write and share reviews.

## How it works
The service uses an API provided by [hotpepper](https://www.hotpepper.jp/) to extract relevant information such as restaurant name, cuisine type, rating, location, and reviews. The data is then stored in a database and displayed in a user-friendly web interface built with React.

The backend is built with Laravel, a PHP web framework, and provides RESTful APIs for the front-end to interact with the database. Users can search for restaurants by name, cuisine type, location, or rating. They can also filter restaurants by various criteria, such as address, phone number.

## Technology stack
The service is built using the following technologies:

- React for building the frontend UI
- Laravel for building the backend APIs
- MySQL for managing the database
- MUI for frontend design
- AWS, Docker for containerization and deployment
